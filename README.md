- The project "job search" will be divided into two roles: Employers and Job seekers. Each role will have certain functions. If you are an employer, you will have the right to post job postings, review candidate profiles, and update personal and company information, but authentication through Gmail is required to be granted permission to operate.

- Functions for employers:
 + Authentication through Gmail
 + Post job listings
 + Review candidate profiles
 + Update personal and company information 
 + ...

- As for job seekers, they will have the right to apply for jobs, save preferred jobs and companies without the need for email verification.

- Functions for job seekers:
 + Without email verification
 + Apply for jobs
 + Save preferred jobs and companies
 + ...

- This separation of roles and their respective functions will streamline the job search process and facilitate communication between employers and job seekers on the platform.
